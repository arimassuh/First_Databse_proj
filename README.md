ok a website?and ??

in that website there is a simple home page where all the navigation bars are shown like home 
,reigstration, login a normal page for a base.

ok, its a website with navigation bars i.e the base page of the website and ?

suppose its a news website and its a paid one then
how to identify the paid and unpaid users?

umm..by storing their details using a registration bar i guess?

correct! and here we are going to store the details of the users in a local database i.e in 
the mongodb database. and handles if the confirpasswords, email is incorrect

ok soo a registration page which stores the data of the user in a local databse 
and handles the errors right?

Yup!Now let me show you how to do it from scrach i.e whole copy paste coding and all

ok lets Go!!

							#how to practically copy patse the whole code

Step 1:Download mongodb compass, node js app, visual studio and open all except node js app.
Step 2: go to my github->whysoserious3555->goto lan repository->select the "mernbackend" folder, 
copy the folder or clone the whole lan repo in your desktop(you can use github desktop for these clone things as its easy)
Step 3:come to ur visual studio code, and open the mernbackend folder which you saved on the desktop
Step 4:open the terminal i.e simply press ctrl+` and the termial/node cmd will open(that black runtime screen)
Step 5:now type "cd desktop/mernbackend" and press enter
Step 6:now type "npm run dev" and press enter ( wait for few minutes and boom ! all
 the local host connection parts will be done and a message will be displayed connection sucessful!)
Step 7:open mongodb compass and there click connect if there is an option for it.(let me tell you that this mongo 
connection is sometimes a pain therefore if you got any problem regarfing it then you can goto technical thapa channel
resful api playlist number 10 and understand the code and if there another problem then check in its comments section
a guy has provided a solution for that problem.) 
Step 8:there will be a "youtuberegistration" link open it .
Step 9: Open chrome and type "localhost:3000" now this page will open which is the home page 
Step 10:Click on registration and type ur details, submit it and if the homepage opens, then we have sucessfully 
registered the website as a user now open the mongodbcompass and check if the details are stored in the youtuberegistration or not.
